1. Start with adding facsimile images with mei-friend
2. Fork repo with skeleton

Attention: fork after the file is properly prepared....

We need to agree on the order of staffs in the score
Creating the `<staffDef>` is also very tedious. Take this away from users and let them start entering notes and rests immediately.

Use mei-friend features

1. add xml:ids to enable interaction
2. duplicate one note with `N`
3. shifting durations doesn't work yet in mei-friend. needs to be added to mei-friend based on schema

Allow features of mei-friend to react properly to different schemas and notations
